# Mobile Text RPG
 A text based RPG built for mobile using Unity and C#
 Built in Unity Version 2018.2.4f1
 
 Mobile Text RPG is a work in progress. Inspired by the popular MUDs of the 1990s like Gemstone IV I wanted to work on a      similar project for mobile platforms. The player finds themselves in a simple dungeon with a grid layout of rooms. The player explores the dungeon using a simple tap-based interface. The player will find treasure and battle monsters until they find the exit. 
 
 TODO:
 - Create more monster types
 - Smooth out the text display system
 - Add a more robust inventory system
 - Make the game multiplayer
