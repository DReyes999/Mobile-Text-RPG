# Mobile Text RPG
 A text based RPG built for mobile using Unity and C#
 Built in Unity Version 2018.2.4f1
 
 Mobile Text RPG is a work in progress. Inspired by the popular MUDs of the 1990s like Gemstone IV I wanted to work on a      similar project for mobile platforms. The player finds themselves in a simple dungeon with a grid layout of rooms. The player explores the dungeon using a simple tap-based interface. The player will find treasure and battle monsters until they find the exit. 
 
 To run the game, clone the repo or download the zip file and open with Unity Version equal to or newer than 2018.2.4f1. Press Play.
